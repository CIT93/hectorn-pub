# To DO list

my idea of what this app would be has changed slightly, originally wanted it to be a tracker for myself but i would like to add:

1. Sleep Diary Entries: Allow users to add diary entries to record additional details about their sleep, such as factors influencing sleep quality

2. Sleep Recommendations and Tips: Offer personalized sleep recommendations and tips based on the user's sleep data. 

3. Customizable Notifications: Implement customizable notifications to remind users to log their sleep data or follow their personalized sleep goals.
